Suppose the original url is https://www.amazon.com/Crayola-Long......... then it will generate something like domain.com/AMAZN-vTYs2. If the url is  https://aliexpress.ru/item/.......... it will generate something like domain.com/ALIEXP-RUS-Xul8P. Original url and redirect url would be saved in a text file in python dictionary form.
