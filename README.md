# Domain-and-Country-based-short-url-generator
Python based url shortener that generates a short url based on the domain and country. You may have heard about tinyurl. Here the short url describes the company and country. Suppose the original url is https://www.amazon.com/Crayola-Long......... then it will generate something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/AMAZN-vTYs2. If the url is  https://aliexpress.ru/item/.......... it will generate something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/ALIEXP-RUS-Xul8P. Original url and redirect url would be saved in a text file in python dictionary form.
Set your domain name instead of localhost http://127.0.0.1:8000
